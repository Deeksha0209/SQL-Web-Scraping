# SQL-Web-Scraping

Worked on 2 seperate datasets! In the first df, I practiced various sql queries and joins in order to solve a murder mystery! In the second task, I used beautiful soup library from python and applied my skills of web scraping - i scraped around 1000 books from the website bookstoscrape.com .
